                <p>Learning to develop as a player is a lot about learning how to strategize your own development,
                    understand your goals and your own opportunities. We provide our participants with the tools to work
                    autonomously, socially, and engaged.</p>

                <p>Mentoring is one of our strongest tools. We have well-known esports profiles that create role models
                    and drive positive values and actions. We work actively to promote diversity and inclusion and
                    counteract sexism, racism, and bullying.</p>
